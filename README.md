For Telco companies it is key to attract new customers and at the same time avoid contract terminations (=churn) to grow their revenue generating base. Looking at churn, different reasons trigger customers to terminate their contracts, for example better price offers, more interesting packages, bad service experiences or change of customers’ personal situations.
Churn analytics provides valuable capabilities to predict customer churn and also define the underlying reasons that drive it. The churn metric is mostly shown as the percentage of customers that cancel a product or service within a given period (mostly months). If a Telco company had 10 Mio. customers on the 1st of January and received 500K contract terminations until the 31st of January the monthly churn for January would be 5%.
Telcos apply machine learning models to predict churn on an individual customer basis and take counter measures such as discounts, special offers or other gratifications to keep their customers. A customer churn analysis is a typical classification problem within the domain of supervised learning.

# Problem Definition
Based on the introduction the key challenge is to predict if an individual customer will churn or not. To accomplish that, machine learning models are trained based on 80% of the sample data. The remaining 20% are used to apply the trained models and assess their predictive power with regards to “churn / not churn”. A side question will be, which features actually drive customer churn. That information can be used to identify customer “pain points” and resolve them by providing goodies to make customers stay.
To compare models and select the best for this task, the accuracy is measured. Based on other characteristics of the data, for example the balance between classes (number of “churners” vs. “non-churners” in data set) further metrics are considered if needed.


# Model Summary
Looking at model results, the best accuracy on the test set is achieved by the Logistic Rgression score (recall = 0.73 and precision = 0.82) . Given the high imbalance of the data towards non-churners, it makes sense to compare F1 scores to get the model with the best score on jointly precision and recall. This would also be the Logistic Regression  with a F1 score of 0.78.
Given the scores of the best performing models, it can be observed that F1 scores are not much above 50%. Further optimization efforts should be carried out to achieve a higher scores and thereby increase prediction power for more business value.
